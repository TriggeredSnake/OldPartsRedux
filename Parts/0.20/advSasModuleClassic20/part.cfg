manufacturer = STEADLER Engineering Corps
description = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket scientists discovered that Kerbal crewmembers just can't be trusted to keep a spacecraft under control. The Advanced S.A.S Module adresses that issue by correcting flight controls continuously. It is highly recommended that crewmembers are kept unaware of the presence of such a device, as experience shows that many Kerbals will see that as a 'challenge to their flying prowess'.
