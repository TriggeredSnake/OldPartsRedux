	description = QBE is Probodobodyne's latest development in probe miniaturization. Despite it's diminutive size, the QBE is a fully-functional and incredibly lightweight command unit. All this goodness comes at a price however: The QBE's tiny enclosure means there is no room for internal reaction wheels, and battery capacity is pitiful at best. Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, many engineers have found it to be ideally suited for those 'optional return' missions.
