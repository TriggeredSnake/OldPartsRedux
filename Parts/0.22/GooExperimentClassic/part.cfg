manufacturer = Found lying by the side of the road.
description = This unit was something one of our engineers came upon while dumpster divin-- Erm, while researching alternative applications for existing technologies. It's a sealed container which appears to be filled with a strange-looking substance. We couldn't reach in or break the canister open, but watching how the Goo behaves when subjected to different situations could be very educational. (Due to this part being multiple-use, it can be very overpowered.)
