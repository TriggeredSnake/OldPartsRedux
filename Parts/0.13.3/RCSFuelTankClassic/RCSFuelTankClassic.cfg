manufacturer = Jebediah Kerman's Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.
description = These fuel tanks carry pressurized gas propellant for RCS thrusters. New advances in plumbing technology made it possible to route RCS lines to any point in the ship. So unlike liquid fuel tanks, RCS Fuel tanks can be placed anywhere.
